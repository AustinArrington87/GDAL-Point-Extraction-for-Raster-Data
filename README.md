# GDAL-Point-Extraction-for-Raster-Data
Python code for extracting the pixel value of raster data in .tif files based on lat/long coordinates. Python code for extracting the pixel value of raster data in .tif files based on lat/long coordinates. Pulling data from the following .tif maps: 1 km MODIS-based Maximum Green Vegetation Fraction (http://landcover.usgs.gov/green_veg.php) and 0.5 km MODIS-based Global Land Cover Climatology ( http://landcover.usgs.gov/global_climatology.php).

NOTE: Make sure to set the GDAL_DATA environment data. Since I installed GDAL with Anacanda, before executing the python file from terminal I ran: 

export GDAL_DATA=/austinarrington/anaconda2/share/gdal
